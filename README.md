I want to be able to click a button in Firefox and have it test the core owncloud functionality

see http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/

Already implemented:

 [x] logout
 [x] login failure warning
 [x] login with admin user
 [x] create test user with cryptic password
 [ ] change password
 [x] check and close welcome dialog
 [x] file upload
 [x] multiple file upload
 [x] file upload autorename
 [ ] whatever we can automate from https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Testplan
     - priority for file related actions and sharing

Currently only works in firefox. But the script can be executed to use it with the selenium webdrivers.

Automated testing FTW!
