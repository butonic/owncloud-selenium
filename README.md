I want to be able to click a button in Firefox and have it test the core owncloud functionality

see http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/

Already implemented:

- [x] logout
- [x] login failure warning
- [x] login with admin user
- [x] create test user with cryptic password
- [x] check and close welcome dialog
- [x] file upload
- [x] multiple file upload
- [x] file upload autorename

I'll try to add whatever we can automate from https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Testplan with priority for file related actions and sharing. Any help is welcome.

Currently only works in Firefox. But the script can be executed to use it with the selenium webdrivers.

Automated testing FTW!
